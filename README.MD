# Because I'm that lazy.
## Script by Karl

* Doesn't require a developer key or elevated permissions (runnable as just an employee)
* Requires Node v8.5.0 (Probably works with 8.5.0+ haven't tested)
* Setup your credentials by running "node index.js --setup"
* I recommend putting "just punch" in shell:startup and pinning "gtfo" to your taskbar.
